# Social Media Analyser Chatbot

This repository contains a social media analyser chatbot built using Langflow and DataStax. Langflow is a no-code platform which helps in building AI models leveraging various LLMs, and DataStax is a vector store database which stores data in the form of vectors. This project was built as a part of a pre-hackathon task for the Level Supermind Hackathon.

## Overview
The chatbot in this repository is designed to analyze social media data and generate insights or responses based on user input. By leveraging Langflow, you can visually build and configure the AI functionality without needing to write extensive code. DataStax serves as the underlying vector store, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval in vector form.

## Features
- No-code interface for creating AI models using Langflow.
- Vector-based data storage and retrieval via DataStax.
- Scalable architecture suitable for handling larger datasets or more complex analysis.
